  Unix (/ˈjuːnɪks/; trademarked as UNIX) is<i> <b> a family of multitasking, multiuser computer </b> </i> operating systems that derive from the original AT&T Unix, whose development started in the 1970s at the Bell Labs research center by Ken Thompson, Dennis Ritchie, and others.[3]

  Unix systems are characterized by a modular design that is sometimes called the "Unix philosophy".<span class="yellow_color"> According </span> to this philosophy, the operating system should provide a set of simple tools, each of which performs a limited, well-defined function.[5] A unified filesystem (the Unix filesystem) and an inter-process communication mechanism known as "pipes" serve as the main means of communication,[3] and a shell scripting and command language (the Unix shell) is used to combine the tools to perform complex workflows.

  Unix distinguishes itself from its predecessors as the first portable operating system: almost the entire<div class="yellow_color"> operating system </div> is written in the C programming language, which allows Unix to operate on numerous platforms.[6]

    The Unix operating system consists of many libraries and utilities along with the master control program, the kernel. The kernel provides services to start and stop programs, handles the file system and other common "low-level" tasks that most programs share, and schedules access to avoid conflicts when <span class="yellow_color">programs </span> try to access the same resource or device simultaneously. To mediate such access, the kernel has special rights, reflected in the distinction of kernel space from user space, the latter being a priority realm where most application programs operate.

  The new operating system was a single-tasking system.[11] In 1970, the group coined the name Unics for Uniplexed Information and Computing Service as a pun on Multics, which stood for Multiplexed Information and Computer Services. Brian Kernighan takes credit for the idea, but adds that "no one can remember" the origin of the final spelling Unix.[16] Dennis Ritchie,[11] Doug McIlroy,[1] and Peter G. Neumann[17] also credit Kernighan.

      In a previous class you wrote pseudocode and flow charts to calculate tax. This problem is very similar to that but may contain some changes and additions.
Write code that will ask the user, using a prompt, what their monthly gross income is. If the user doesn't type in a number tell them their mistake with an alert and do not proceed with the calculation.
</p>
<p>
  Ask a user to type in their first and last name into a single prompt separated by a space. You can assume the user will do this correctly.
In a single alert write the following message where the square brackets represents values:
  </p>
</div>


<span class ="red_color_for_font">Hello!</span> some other text.

<div class="blue_color_for_font">hello!!</div> some other text.
