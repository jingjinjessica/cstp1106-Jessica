   <p1> Hello everyone!!! My name is Jesssica Jin, welcome to my homepage. I am a student at Vancouver Community College (VCC) and have been taking  Computer System Technology Program (CSTP). This is my first semester so everything is very interesting. Although some courses are difficult for me, I believe I can achieve them. I really enjoy the process of overcoming difficulties and solving problems. </p1>
